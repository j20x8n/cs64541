Behavioral   Economics and   Policy   Design

Course   Prerequisite
CORE-GP   1011: Statistics    CORE-GP   1018:   Microeconomics   (or   equivalent)
Course   Description
Standard economic theory assumes that   individuals are fully rational   decision-makers;   however,   that   is often not the case   in   the   real world.   Behavioral   economics   uses findings   from   lab   and   field experiments to advance existing economic   models   by identifying ways   in which   individuals   are systematically irrational. This course gives an   overview   of   key   insights from   behavioral   science and identifies ways   in which these findings   have   been used to   advance   policies   on education,   health, energy, taxation, and   more. Additionally, this course will   review how government agencies and   non-profit organizations   have used   behavioral   insights to   improve   social   policy.

Semi-Weekly Assignments
Researchers working   in public   policy must frequently adapt their writing style. turning   a   technical,   academic journal article into a   policy brief for government officials, a   New York   Times   article,   a   National   Public   Radio spot, or a tweet. One of the   main goals   of this   class   is   to   learn to   digest   academic   research to   make economics   insights understandable to a   policy audience. These   semi-weekly assignments will give students   practice   in four types of policy writing:
•            Data visualization tweets
•            Opinion editorial
•            Policy   brief
•            Policy   proposals
Students will submit semi-weekly assignments via   Brightspace. These will   be graded as   check   ++, check+, check, check   minus,   no   credit   which   corresponds   to   100/95/85/75/0.   Late assignments   will   lose   10   points   per   24-hour   period   starting   at   the   beginning   of   class   in   which   the assignment is due. One   make-up tweet   is available to   earn   additional   credit:   this   can   replace   a either a   missed assignment or the assignment with the lowest   grade.
